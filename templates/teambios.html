					Ariel Abramov was born in Netanya, Israel in 1992. At the age of 8 his dad got him a computer where he was instantly hooked. He learned HTML at the age of 10. At the age of 12 he moved to Melbourne, Australia with his family and attended Bialik High School. His love for HTML pushed him to want to know more so he took private lessons for JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					He developed a love for martial arts at the age of 14 and started taking taekwondo classes, but at the age of 15 his parents decided to move back to Israel. He signed up for Jeet Kune Do at 16 which led him to do Mixed Martial Arts less than two years later. At the age of 19 he moved to China for 3 months to live and train in a Shaolin temple. When he got back he worked as a diamond cutter for 2 years and then decided to move back to Melbourne to study Information Technology. On November 2016 he completed his Bachelors of Information Technology.
